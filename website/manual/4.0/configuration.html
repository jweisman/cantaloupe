<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Configuration is normally obtained from a file in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties">.properties format</a>. A sample file, called <span class="filename">cantaloupe.properties.sample</span>, is included in the distribution archive. It is recommended to make a copy of this file and use the copy as your configuration file. It can be located anywhere, and named anything.</p>

<p>To tell the application where the file is located, supply the <code>-Dcantaloupe.config</code> VM option, pointing to an absolute or relative path to the file. (See <a href="getting-started.html#Running">Getting Started</a> for examples.)</p>

<p>Configuration files may contain an <code>extends</code> key pointing to the pathname or same-directory filename of another configuration file. This enables multiple instances to share common configuration keys.</p>

<p>Keys in child files override ones in parent files. When the same key is defined in multiple files, instances will use the most specific one.</p>

<p>Multiple <code>extends</code> keys in the same file are not supported. If they are present, only the last one will be used.</p>

<p>The configuration file will be automatically reloaded within a few seconds of a change. Changes to most keys take effect immediately, but some require a restart; see the inline comments for documentation of which.</p>

<p>When using <a href="#Inheritance">inheritance</a>, any file in the <code>extends</code> chain that changes will be reloaded by all instances in whose <code>extends</code> chain it appears.</p>

<h2 id="Remote Changes">Remote Changes</h2>

<p>The configuration can be updated remotely via the <a href="remote-management.html#HTTP%20API">HTTP API</a>. When a change is received, it will be activated immediately and written out to the configuration file, if it is writable.</p>

<p>When using <a href="#Inheritance">inheritance</a>, a key will be written to the most specific file that already contains it, or to the main (child) file, if none already contain it.</p>
