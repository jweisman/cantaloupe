<p>Cantaloupe offers a sophisticated and customizable caching subsystem that is capable of meeting a variety of needs while remaining easy to use. Several tiers of cache are available:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#Client-Side Caching">Client-side caches</a>, which it has no control over but can provide hints to</li>
  <li>A <a href="#Source%20Cache">source cache</a>, which caches source images on a local filesystem (if they are not already on one) for faster reading</li>
  <li>A <a href="#Derivative%20Cache">derivative cache</a>, which caches processed images and source image characteristics</li>
  <li>An <a href="#Info%20Cache">info cache</a>, which caches source image characteristics in memory</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 id="Client-Side Caching">Client-Side Caching</h2>

<p>Cantaloupe can provide caching hints to clients using a <code>Cache-Control</code> response header, which is configurable via the
<code>cache.client.*</code> keys in the configuration file. To enable this header, set the <code>cache.client.enabled</code> key to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>The default settings look something like this:</p>

{% highlight properties %}
cache.client.max_age = 2592000
cache.client.shared_max_age =
cache.client.public = true
cache.client.private = false
cache.client.no_cache = false
cache.client.no_store = false
cache.client.must_revalidate = false
cache.client.proxy_revalidate = false
cache.client.no_transform = true
{% endhighlight %}

<p>These are reasonable defaults that tell clients they can keep cached images for 2,592,000 seconds (30 days).</p>

<p>The <code>Cache-Control</code> header will be returned only in HTTP 200-level responses.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="Server-Side Caching">Server-Side Caching</h2>

<h3 id="Source Cache">Source Cache</h3>

<p>Commonly, source images will be served from a local filesystem using <a href="sources.html#FilesystemSource">FilesystemSource</a>. There, they are already as local as they can be, so there would be no point in caching them&mdash;although a <a href="#Derivative%20Cache">derivative cache</a> could still be of great benefit.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="sources.html">Sources</a> section, though, images do not have to be served from a local filesystem&mdash;they can also be served from a remote web server, cloud storage, or wherever. The source cache can be beneficial when one of these non-filesystem sources performs poorer than ideal. By setting the <a href="processors.html#Stream%20Retrieval%20Strategy">stream retrieval strategy</a> to <code>CacheStrategy</code> and <a href="#FilesystemCache">configuring FilesystemCache</a>, all source images from non-FilesystemSources will be automatically downloaded into the source cache and read from there.</p>

<p>Another reason for a source cache is to work around the <a href="processors.html#Retrieval%20Strategies">incompatibility between certain processors and sources</a>. Some processors are only capable of reading source images located on the filesystem. By setting the <a href="processors.html#Fallback%20Retrieval%20Strategy">fallback retrieval strategy</a> to <code>CacheStrategy</code>, and then <a href="#FilesystemCache">configuring FilesystemCache</a>, the source cache will be utilized to deal with incompatible processor/source situations by automatically pre-downloading source images, as a more robust alternative to <code>DownloadStrategy</code>.</p>

<p>The source cache is integrated into the larger caching architecture, so all of the information about <a href="#Modes%20of%20Operation">modes of operation</a> and <a href="#Maintenance">maintenance</a> applies to both the source and derivative caches.</p>

<p>Note that there is only one available source cache implementation&mdash;<a href="#FilesystemCache">FilesystemCache</a>&mdash;and it is used independently of the derivative cache.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="Derivative Cache">Derivative Cache</h3>

<p>The derivative cache caches post-processed images in order to spare the computational expense of processing the same image over and over again. Derivative caches are pluggable, in order to enable different cache stores.</p>

<p>Derivative caching is recommended in production, as it will greatly reduce load on the server and improve response times accordingly. There are other ways of caching derivatives, such as by using a caching reverse proxy, but the built-in derivative cache is custom-tailored for this application and easy enough to set up.</p>

<p>Derivative caching is disabled by default. To enable it, set <code>cache.server.derivative.enabled</code> to <code>true</code>, and set <code>cache.server.derivative</code> to the name of a cache, such as <a href="#FilesystemCache">FilesystemCache</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Derivative Cache Bypassing">Bypassing</h4>

<p>The derivative cache can be bypassed on a per-request basis by supplying a <code>cache=false</code> query argument in the URL. When present, the derivative cache will not be read from, nor written to, whether or not it is enabled. The <code>Cache-Control</code> header will also be omitted from responses.</p>

<h4 id="Notes">Notes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Requests for full-sized, unaltered source images are not cached, and are instead streamed through with no processing.</li>
  <li>IIIF information response representations are not cached&mdash;only image info, which is the only expensive part to acquire. This means it is possible to change other configuration options that would affect the contents of information responses without invalidating the cache.</li>
  <li>When derivative caching is enabled, "miss" responses are streamed to the client and cache simultaneously. If the cache I/O is slower than the connection to the client, response times may be impaired.</li>
  <li>The derivative cache is shared across endpoints. Requests for the same image from different endpoints will return the same cached image.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3 id="Info Cache">Info Cache</h3>

<p>The info cache caches image info objects in the Java heap, independently of the derivative cache. When both are enabled, the info cache acts as a "level 1" cache in front of the "level 2" derivative cache:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Requested image infos are retrieved from the info cache, if available;</li>
  <li>If not, they are retrieved from the derivative cache, if available, and added to the info cache;</li>
  <li>If not available in any cache, they are retrieved from a processor, and added to both the info and derivative caches&mdash;whichever are enabled.</li>
</ol>

<p>The info cache can be enabled or disabled via the <code>cache.server.info.enabled</code> configuration key.</p>

<p>The info cache is cluster-safe: when multiple instances are sharing the same derivative cache, there will never (for more than a short period of time) be an info in an instance's info cache that isn't also present in the derivative cache.</p>

<p>The maximum size of the info cache is hard-coded to a reasonable percentage of the maximum heap size, and is not configurable. As infos are very small, the maximum size is unlikely to ever be reached, but if it is, the least-recently-accessed infos will be invalidated as necessary to accommodate fresher ones.</p>

<p>The info cache's content never expires, but it is not persisted, so it will be lost when the application exits.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="Modes of Operation">Modes of Operation</h3>

<p>The source and derivative caches can be configured to operate in one of two ways:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Conservative (<code>cache.server.resolve_first = true</code>)</dt>
  <dd>Source images are looked up and verified to exist before cached representations are returned. This precludes returning a cached representation when the underlying resource no longer exists, but also impairs response times by a variable amount, depending on the source.</dd>
  <dt>Aggressive (<code>cache.server.resolve_first = false</code>)</dt>
  <dd>Cached content is returned immediately, if available. This is faster, but inconsistency can develop between the cache and the underlying source image storage, if the latter is not static.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h3 id="Maintenance">Maintenance</h3>

<p>Because cached content is not automatically deleted after becoming invalid, there will likely be a certain amount of invalid content taking up space in the cache at any given time. Without periodic maintenance, the amount can only grow. If this is a problem, it can be dealt with manually via the <a href="remote-management.html#HTTP%20API">HTTP API</a>, or automatically, using a cache worker, which periodically cleans and purges invalid items. (See the <code>cache.server.worker.*</code> configuration options.)</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="Limiting">Limiting</h3>

<p>Most caches (with the exception of <a href="#HeapCache">HeapCache</a>) age-limit their content based on last-accessed or last-modified time. Depending on the amount of source content served, the varieties of derivatives generated, the time-to-live setting, and how often <a href="#Maintenance">maintenance</a> is performed, the cache may grow very large. Its size is not tracked, as this would be either expensive, or, for some cache implementations, impossible. Managing the cache size is therefore the responsibility of the administrator, and it can be accomplished by any combination of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Performing maintenance more often;</li>
  <li>Reducing the time-to-live (using the <code>cache.server.derivative.ttl_seconds</code> configuration key);</li>
  <li>Increasing the threshold by allocating more storage to the cache.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3 id="Implementations">Implementations</h3>

<p class="text text-info"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> All implementations are thread-, process-, and cluster-safe, where applicable. Multiple application instances can be pointed at the same cache store without conflicting.</p>

<h4 id="FilesystemCache">FilesystemCache</h4>

<p>FilesystemCache caches content in a filesystem tree. The tree structure looks like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>FilesystemCache.pathname</code>/
    <ul>
      <li><span class="filename">source/</span>
        <sup><a href="#FilesystemCache-1">(1)</a></sup>
        <ul>
          <li>Intermediate subdirectories
            <sup><a href="#FilesystemCache-2">(2)</a></sup>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="filename">{hashed identifier}</span>
                <sup><a href="#FilesystemCache-3">(3)</a></sup></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="filename">image/</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Intermediate subdirectories
            <sup><a href="#FilesystemCache-2">(2)</a></sup>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="filename">{hashed identifier}_{hashed operation list string representation}.{output format extension}</span>
                <sup><a href="#FilesystemCache-3">(3)</a></sup></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="filename">info/</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Intermediate subdirectories
            <sup><a href="#FilesystemCache-2">(2)</a></sup>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="filename">{hashed identifier}.json</span>
                <sup><a href="#FilesystemCache-3">(3)</a></sup></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li id="FilesystemCache-1">Empty unless <a href="#Source%20Cache">source caching</a> is enabled.</li>
  <li id="FilesystemCache-2">Some filesystems have per-directory file count limits, or thresholds beyond which performance starts to degrade.

  <li id="FilesystemCache-3">Identifier and operation list strings in filenames are MD5-hashed in order to allow for lengths longer than the filesystem's filename length limit.</li>

<hr>

<h4 id="HeapCache">HeapCache</h4>

<p>HeapCache caches derivative images and metadata in the Java heap, which is the main area of memory available to the JVM. This is the fastest of the caches, with the main drawback being that it cannot be shared across instances.</p>

<p>Unlike most of the other caches, this one does not age-limit content. When the target size (<code>HeapCache.target_size</code>) has been exceeded, the minimum number of least-recently-accessed items are purged that will reduce it back down to this size. (The configured target size may be safely changed while the application is running.)</p>

<p>Because this cache is not time-limited, <code>cache.server.derivative.ttl_seconds</code> does not apply, and, if enabled, the <a href="#Maintenance">cache worker</a> will remain idle.</p>

<p>When using this cache, ensure that your heap is able to grow large enough to accommodate the desired target size (using the <code>-Xmx</code> VM option), and that you have enough RAM to accommodate this size.</p>

<h5>Persistence</h5>

<p>This cache can persist its contents to disk using the <code>HeapCache.persist</code> and <code>HeapCache.persist.filesystem.pathname</code> configuration keys. When persistence is enabled, the contents of the cache will be written to a file at shutdown, and loaded back in at startup. If persistence is disabled, the cache contents will be lost when the application exits.</p>

<p>Some thought was given to storing cached data using the same on-disk format used by <a href="#FilesystemCache">FilesystemCache</a>, so that persisted data would be compatible between these caches. Unfortunately, this is not possible because of the one-way hashing used in the FilesystemCache format.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="JdbcCache">JdbcCache</h4>

<p>JdbcCache caches derivative images and metadata in relational database tables. To use this cache, a JDBC driver for your database must be installed on the classpath.</p>

<p>JdbcCache is tested with the H2 database. It is known <strong>not</strong> to work with the official PostgreSQL driver, as of version 9.4.1207. Other databases may work, but are untested.</p>

<p>JdbcCache can be configured with the following options:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>JdbcCache.url</code></dt>
  <dd>JDBC connection URL; for example, <code>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase</code>.</dd>
  <dt><code>JdbcCache.user</code></dt>
  <dd>User to connect to the database as.</dd>
  <dt><code>JdbcCache.password</code></dt>
  <dd>Password to use when connecting to the database. Can be left blank if not needed.</dd>
  <dt><code>JdbcCache.image_table</code></dt>
  <dd>Table in which to cache derivative (post-processed) images.</dd>
  <dt><code>JdbcCache.info_table</code></dt>
  <dd>Table in which to cache information responses.</dd>
</dl>

<p>JdbcCache will not create its schema automatically&mdash;this must be done manually using the following commands, which may have to be altered slightly for your particular database:</p>

{% highlight sql %}
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {JdbcCache.derivative_image_table} (
   operations VARCHAR(4096) NOT NULL,
   image BLOB,
   last_accessed DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {JdbcCache.info_table} (
  identifier VARCHAR(4096) NOT NULL,
  info VARCHAR(8192) NOT NULL,
  last_accessed DATETIME
);

CREATE INDEX operations_idx ON {JdbcCache.derivative_image_table} (operations);
CREATE INDEX identifier_idx ON {JdbcCache.info_table} (identifier);
{% endhighlight %}

<hr>

<h4 id="S3Cache">S3Cache</h4>

<p>S3Cache caches derivative images and metadata in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. It supports both AWS and non-AWS endpoints.</p>

<h5>Configuration</h5>

<p>S3Cache is configured (excepting credentials) using the following configuration keys:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>S3Cache.endpoint</code></dt>
  <dd>URI or hostname of an S3 endpont. For AWS endpoints, this will be a value like <code>s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>. (See the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region">list of AWS S3 regions</a>.)</dd>
  <dt><code>S3Cache.bucket.name</code></dt>
  <dd>Name of the bucket to contain cached content.</dd>
  <dt><code>S3Cache.object_key_prefix</code></dt>
  <dd>String to prepend to object keys&mdash;for example, to achieve a virtual folder hierarchy.</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Credentials Sources</h5>

<p>See the <a href="sources.html#S3SourceCredentialsSources">Credentials Sources</a> information for S3Source. S3Cache works the same way, except that the credentials-related configuration keys, if you choose to use them, are different:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>S3Cache.access_key_id</code></dt>
  <dd>An access key associated with your AWS account. (See <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials">AWS Security Credentials</a>.)</dd>
  <dt><code>S3Cache.secret_key</code></dt>
  <dd>A secret key associated with your AWS account. (See <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials">AWS Security Credentials</a>.)</dd>
</dl>

<p class="text-info">
  <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> S3 does not provide a last-accessed time in object metadata, so the time-to-live is on the basis of last-modified time instead.
</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="AzureStorageCache">AzureStorageCache</h4>

<p>AzureStorageCache caches derivative images and metadata into a Microsoft Azure Storage container. It can be configured with the following options:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>AzureStorageCache.account_name</code></dt>
  <dd>The name of your Azure account.</dd>
  <dt><code>AzureStorageCache.account_key</code></dt>
  <dd>A key to access your Azure Storage account.</dd>
  <dt><code>AzureStorageCache.container_name</code></dt>
  <dd>Name of the container from which to serve images.</dd>
  <dt><code>AzureStorageCache.object_key_prefix</code></dt>
  <dd>String to prepend to object keys&mdash;for example, to achieve a virtual folder hierarchy.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="text-info">
  <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Azure Storage does not provide a last-accessed time in object metadata, so the time-to-live is on the basis of last-modified time instead.
</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="RedisCache">RedisCache</h4>

<p>RedisCache, available since version 3.4, caches derivative images and metadata using the <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> data structure store. It supports the following configuration options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>RedisCache.host</code></li>
  <li><code>RedisCache.port</code></li>
  <li><code>RedisCache.ssl</code></li>
  <li><code>RedisCache.password</code></li>
  <li><code>RedisCache.database</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike with the other caches, cache policy is configured on the Redis side, and <code>cache.server.derivative.ttl_seconds</code> will have no effect with this cache. Likewise, if enabled, the <a href="#Maintenance">cache worker</a> will remain idle.</p>
